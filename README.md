## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

- **A local GPU with at least 16GB of VRAM is required.**
- The backend is **designed to run on a single GPU**, so all requests are **processed sequentially**.
- For optimal performance (especially in a cloud environment), the system **should be refactored to support async request handling.**
